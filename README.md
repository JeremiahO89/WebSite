# WebSite First Attempt
First attempt at making a website. Repository was started Jan-28-2024.

Goal's: Learn how websites work (frontend / backend), figure out how to live link mechanics such as youtube and projects for employers. Eventually link live data to the site such as data from a live camera, and raspberry pi controlling something in the physical world like lights.



1st Goal Objective: Make a resume website by the end of 2024 Summer 

Update: May-23-2024. The majority of the website is completed, it consists of a Home Page, Clubs Page, Projects Page, and Resume Page. The pages are mostly complete they need to be combed through for spelling mistakes, and some photos still need uploaded. None of the more detail links work yet, because they are not as high up on the objectives list currently. I would like to work on another project instead of spending hours making very similar sites.
